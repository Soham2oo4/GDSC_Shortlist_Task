Before classification of text sentiment, the plain text documents need to be transformed into features for machine learning classification of the sentiments as positive or negative. I have compared 3 features extraction techniques in the IMDb dataset which are bag of Words, TF-IDF(Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) and trigram. Post this feature extraction, I used logistic regression as a machine learning approach to predict the sentiment is postive or negative. The input to this logistic regression was the features selected from each of the feature selection techniques(BoW, Trigram and TF-IDF). The accuracy and F1 score was calculated for all the three. It showed TF-IDF was the best feature extraction technique.
